### Vector Field Motion ###
This is a tool to visualize 2d vector fields. It shows how particles throughout the coordinate plane are influenced by the push of the field. Going to make a 3d field visualizer soon.

### Examples ###
(Note, these examples are recorded several seconds into the simulation)

#### Vector field of <sin(y/2), cos(x/2)> ####

#### Vector field of <x^2 - y^2, xy> ####
